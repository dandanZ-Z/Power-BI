# Power-BI
A repository containing my Power BI files for a short Data Analysis about DA professionals.
Some trends interpreted from the dashboard:
1. India QOL is lower as they have the least happiness across the board, and have a lower pay.
2. Canadians have the hardest time breaking into the industry but have above average happiness.
3. It is very hard for students to get into university courses that deal with data.
